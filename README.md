The purpose of a Med School Admissions System is to streamline, automate, and enhance the efficiency, fairness, and transparency of the medical school application process. 
By digitizing and centralizing key processes, it reduces administrative burden, increases accuracy, and provides applicants with a smoother, more accessible experience while ensuring that the admissions team can make informed, consistent, and data-driven decisions. 
Ultimately, the goal is to admit the most qualified candidates who will succeed in medical education and contribute to the healthcare profession.
